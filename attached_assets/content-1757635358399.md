# OSS Vibe Coding Platform

This is a **demo** of an end-to-end coding platform where the user can enter text prompts, and the agent will create a full stack application.

It uses Vercel's AI Cloud services like [Sandbox](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-sandbox) for secure code execution, [AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) for GPT-5 and other models support, [Fluid Compute](https://vercel.com/fluid) for efficient rendering and streaming, and it's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction).
