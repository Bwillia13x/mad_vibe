You are resuming work on the Value Venture Lab workflow IDE (monorepo with Express API + Vite/React client). Key context:

Status at handoff (Sept 19, 2025):
- Navigation shell (`client/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`) wraps all routes; new layout helpers (`PageContainer`, `PageHeader`, `GlassCard`) live in `client/src/components/layout/Page.tsx`.
- Home, Analytics, Inventory, and Marketing pages were restyled to the slate/violet “glass” aesthetic and now pull live workflow/marketing data (`client/src/pages/home.tsx`, `analytics.tsx`, `inventory.tsx`, `marketing.tsx`).
- Workbench inspector chips now trigger Omni-Prompt shortcuts (`client/src/components/workbench/panels.tsx`, `WorkbenchLayout.tsx`).
- Server-side guards were added so drizzle/database operations tolerate missing POSTGRES configs (see `lib/db/*`, `server/routes.ts`, `server/routes/workflow.ts`, `server/storage.ts`).
- Smoke/build/lint/type checks all pass (`npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run check`).

Open objectives:
1. Restyle the remaining operations dashboards (scheduling, staff, loyalty, POS, performance-dashboard pages) to use the new layout components and Value Venture Lab visual system. Match typography, glass cards, and accent chips.
2. Add responsive breakpoints (tablet and mobile) for the new dashboards and workbench shell, ensuring navigation and cards collapse gracefully.
3. Perform accessibility cleanup: keyboard focus styles, contrast checks, and (time permitting) run an automated axe or Lighthouse scan to document follow-ups.
4. Enrich workbench tabs with deeper live data (e.g., scenario charts, memo excerpts, or valuation KPI summaries) once the styling sweep is complete.
5. Document residual gaps for future work (remaining components or API needs).

Helpful references:
- `client/src/components/layout/` for shared layout primitives.
- `client/src/components/workbench/stage-tabs.tsx` for tab structure needing richer content.
- Existing restyled pages listed above for design patterns.
- Tests in `client/test/unit` cover status tone utilities; keep them green and extend if new helpers are introduced.

Workflow expectations:
- Continue using glass card helpers for new UI instead of duplicating styles; prefer tailwind utility classes already in use.
- Keep lint/type/test commands green (`npm run lint`, `npm run check`, `npm test`). If you add Vitest specs, co-locate them under `client/test`.
- Record any accessibility/performance findings (even partial) so they can inform product QA later.

Deliverables for this session:
- Updated remaining pages with Value Venture styling and responsive behavior.
- Documented accessibility/perf observations plus a short TODO list for the next milestone.
- Summary of next steps in the project once these UI tasks are wrapped.
