# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing and validation requirements for the Andreas Vibe business management platform prior to client handoff. The platform is a demo-ready Express + Vite React application with multiple business modules including Chat (AI assistant), POS, Marketing, Loyalty, Scheduling, Inventory, and Analytics. The testing plan must ensure all functionality works correctly, performance meets expectations, security is validated, and the platform is ready for production deployment.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want deployment and infrastructure validation, so that the platform can be reliably deployed to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker deployment is tested THEN the system SHALL build and run correctly in containerized environments
2. WHEN environment configuration is tested THEN the system SHALL work with and without optional environment variables
3. WHEN database connectivity is tested THEN the system SHALL handle both in-memory and PostgreSQL database configurations
4. WHEN production build is tested THEN the system SHALL build successfully and serve static assets correctly
5. WHEN health monitoring is tested THEN the system SHALL provide accurate health check endpoints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want performance and scalability testing, so that the platform meets performance requirements under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load testing is performed THEN the system SHALL handle expected concurrent user loads without degradation
2. WHEN response time testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL meet acceptable latency requirements for all endpoints
3. WHEN memory usage is tested THEN the system SHALL operate within acceptable memory limits
4. WHEN database performance is tested THEN the system SHALL execute queries efficiently
5. WHEN streaming functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL handle AI chat streaming without performance issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want data integrity and business logic validation, so that all business processes work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POS transactions are tested THEN the system SHALL accurately calculate totals, taxes, and discounts
2. WHEN inventory management is tested THEN the system SHALL correctly track stock levels and low inventory alerts
3. WHEN scheduling functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL properly manage appointments and staff assignments
4. WHEN loyalty program is tested THEN the system SHALL accurately track points and rewards
5. WHEN marketing campaigns are tested THEN the system SHALL correctly manage campaign states and performance metrics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a client stakeholder, I want user acceptance testing validation, so that the platform meets business requirements and user expectations.
