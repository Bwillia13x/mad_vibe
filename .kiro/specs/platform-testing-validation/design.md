# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines a comprehensive testing and validation strategy for the Andreas Vibe business management platform prior to client handoff. The platform is a full-stack Express + React application with multiple business modules including Chat (AI assistant), POS, Marketing, Loyalty, Scheduling, Inventory, and Analytics. The testing strategy encompasses functional testing, performance validation, security assessment, deployment verification, and user acceptance testing to ensure production readiness.

The platform currently has a solid foundation of automated testing including smoke tests, E2E tests, and CI/CD pipeline validation. This design builds upon existing infrastructure while identifying and addressing gaps in test coverage, security validation, and production readiness.

### Test Environment Architecture

The testing strategy utilizes multiple environments to ensure comprehensive validation:

1. **Local Development Environment**: For unit tests and initial integration testing
2. **Ephemeral Test Environment**: Dynamically created for isolated testing using existing smoke test infrastructure
3. **Staging Environment**: Production-like environment for final validation
4. **Docker Environment**: Containerized testing to validate deployment scenarios

### Existing Testing Infrastructure Analysis

The platform already includes robust testing infrastructure:

- **Smoke Tests**: Comprehensive API endpoint validation, streaming functionality, demo scenarios
