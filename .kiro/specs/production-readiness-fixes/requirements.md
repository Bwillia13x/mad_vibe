# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements to resolve all critical issues identified in the client handoff assessment for the Andreas Vibe business management platform. The assessment revealed critical security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and user workflow problems that must be addressed before production deployment. This specification focuses on achieving production readiness by systematically addressing each blocking issue.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all critical security vulnerabilities resolved, so that the platform is secure for production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication bypass prevention is tested THEN the system SHALL properly validate all authentication headers and prevent unauthorized access
2. WHEN XSS prevention is tested THEN the system SHALL sanitize all user inputs and prevent cross-site scripting attacks
3. WHEN environment variable security is validated THEN the system SHALL securely handle all sensitive configuration data
4. WHEN security headers are tested THEN the system SHALL include all required security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, CSP)
5. WHEN comprehensive security testing is performed THEN the system SHALL pass all security tests with zero critical vulnerabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want all performance issues under load resolved, so that the platform can handle production traffic reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load testing is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain error rates below 1% threshold under all load conditions
2. WHEN concurrent user testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL handle 50+ concurrent users without performance degradation
3. WHEN sustained load testing is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain stable performance for extended periods
4. WHEN error handling is tested THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms and graceful degradation
5. WHEN resource management is validated THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage connections and prevent resource exhaustion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user experience engineer, I want all broken user workflows fixed, so that end-to-end functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loyalty system workflows are tested THEN the system SHALL allow proper customer selection and points management
2. WHEN marketing campaign workflows are tested THEN the system SHALL provide functional campaign filtering and management
3. WHEN end-to-end user journeys are validated THEN the system SHALL complete all critical business workflows without errors
4. WHEN UI element accessibility is tested THEN the system SHALL provide proper element identification and interaction
5. WHEN cross-module workflows are tested THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency across all business modules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want infrastructure and deployment issues resolved, so that the platform can be reliably deployed to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker deployment is tested THEN the system SHALL build and run correctly in containerized environments
2. WHEN production environment configuration is tested THEN the system SHALL work with all required environment variables and configurations
3. WHEN monitoring and logging are validated THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive production-ready monitoring
4. WHEN health checks are tested THEN the system SHALL provide accurate health status and diagnostic information
5. WHEN deployment procedures are validated THEN the system SHALL support reliable deployment and rollback processes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive validation of all fixes, so that the platform meets production readiness standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security fixes are validated THEN the system SHALL pass all security tests with zero critical issues
2. WHEN performance fixes are validated THEN the system SHALL meet all performance thresholds under load
3. WHEN user workflow fixes are validated THEN the system SHALL complete all end-to-end scenarios successfully
4. WHEN infrastructure fixes are validated THEN the system SHALL deploy and operate reliably in production-like environments
5. WHEN final integration testing is performed THEN the system SHALL achieve 98%+ overall readiness score

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want systematic tracking and validation of fix implementation, so that progress toward production readiness is measurable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fix implementation is tracked THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress indicators for each critical issue
2. WHEN validation testing is performed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate measurable improvement in readiness scores
3. WHEN regression testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL maintain existing functionality while implementing fixes
4. WHEN final validation is performed THEN the system SHALL generate updated handoff assessment with greenlight status
5. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive deployment and maintenance guides reflecting all fixes
