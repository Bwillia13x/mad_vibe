# ✅ Phase 2 Complete: Enhanced AI Capabilities

**Completed:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** Advanced AI Integration Complete

---

## 🎉 What's New in Phase 2

Phase 2 transforms the basic AI copilot into a **powerful, context-aware assistant** with conversation memory, workspace intelligence, and code generation capabilities.

### Major Enhancements

#### 1. ✅ Conversation Memory & Multi-Turn Support

- **Backend:** AI API now accepts conversation history
- **Frontend:** Sends last 10 messages for context
- **Result:** AI remembers previous exchanges
- **Example:** "Use the WACC we calculated earlier" → AI recalls it

#### 2. ✅ Workspace Context Enrichment

- **Backend:** Automatically loads workspace data when workspaceId provided
- **Includes:**
  - Workspace name, ticker, company name
  - Investment thesis/description
  - Completed workflow stages
  - Recent artifacts (last 5)
  - Last active stage
- **Result:** AI understands full workspace context without manual input

#### 3. ✅ Enhanced Domain Expertise

- **Capabilities Added:**
  - Excel formula generation
  - DCF model code generation
  - Financial calculations
  - SQL-like query generation for screeners
  - Owner earnings bridge formulas
  - WACC calculations with components

#### 4. ✅ Stage-Specific Intelligence

- **Updated instructions per stage:**
  - **Screener:** Generate queries, suggest filters
  - **Financials:** Create Excel formulas, flag red flags
  - **Valuation:** Generate DCF formulas, calculate terminal values
  - **Scenarios:** Monte Carlo logic, sensitivity analysis
  - **Memo:** Draft outlines, thesis statements
  - **Red Team:** Aggressive assumption challenging

## 🧠 How It Works

### Conversation Flow with Memory

```
User: "What's a good WACC for Apple?"
AI: "For Apple (AAPL), a WACC of 8-9% is reasonable given..."

User: "Use that to calculate terminal value"
AI: "Using WACC = 8.5% from our discussion, terminal value = ..."
      ↑ AI remembers the 8.5% from earlier
```

### Workspace Intelligence

```
User opens AI assistant in "AAPL Analysis" workspace

Backend automatically loads:
- Workspace: AAPL Analysis (AAPL)
- Thesis: "Undervalued given services growth"
- Completed stages: Intake, Screener, Data
- Artifacts: 10-K Normalized, Owner Earnings Bridge
- Last stage: Valuation

AI receives full context without user explaining anything
```

### Code Generation Example

```
User: "Generate a DCF formula for 10-year projection"

AI: "Here's the DCF formula:
=NPV($B$1, C5:L5) + (L5 * (1 + $B$2)) / ($B$1 - $B$2) / (1 + $B$1)^10

Where:
- B1: WACC (8.5%)
- B2: Terminal growth rate (2.5%)
- C5:L5: FCF years 1-10
- Terminal value discounted to present
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (`server/routes/ai-copilot.ts`)

**New Parameters Accepted:**

```typescript
{
  prompt: string,              // User's message
  context: {                   // Existing context
    stageSlug, stageTitle,
    workspaceName, ticker
  },
  capability: string,          // suggest, generate, analyze, etc.
  conversationHistory: [{      // NEW: Last 10 messages
    role: 'user' | 'assistant',
    content: string
  }],
  workspaceId: number          // NEW: For enrichment
}
```

**Context Enrichment:**

```typescript
async function enrichWorkspaceContext(workspaceId) {
  // Loads from database:
  - workspace details (name, ticker, thesis)
  - stage completions
  - recent artifacts (last 5)

  // Adds to AI context automatically
}
```

**Enhanced System Prompt:**

```typescript
"You are an advanced AI copilot in MAD Vibe.
Expertise in:
- Financial statement analysis
- DCF modeling, EPV, comps
- Investment memo writing
- Excel formula generation     ← NEW
- Risk analysis

Current Investment: AAPL Analysis (AAPL)
Thesis: Undervalued given services growth
Available Artifacts: 3 items
- 10-K FY2024 Normalized (note)
- Owner Earnings Bridge (model)
...
"
```

### Frontend Changes (`client/src/components/ai/FloatingAIAssistant.tsx`)

**Now Sends:**

```typescript
fetch('/api/copilot', {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: userInput,
    conversationHistory: messages.slice(-10),  // Last 10 for context
    workspaceId: currentWorkspace.id,           // Trigger enrichment
    context: { stageSlug, stageTitle, ... },
    capability: 'suggest'
  })
})
```

**Response Includes:**

```typescript
{
  response: "...",
  contextUsed: {
    hasHistory: true,        // Conversation memory used
    workspaceEnriched: true  // Workspace data loaded
  }
}
```

## 🎯 New Capabilities

### 1. Formula Generation

**User:** "Generate owner earnings formula"

**AI Response:**

```
Owner Earnings Formula:

=B5 + B6 - B7 - B8 + B9

Where:
B5: Net Income
B6: D&A (non-cash charges)
B7: Maintenance CapEx
B8: Working Capital increase
B9: Other adjustments

Or in Excel with named ranges:
=NetIncome + DA - MaintenanceCapEx - DeltaWC
```

### 2. Contextual Memory

**User:** "What were the red flags we discussed?"

**AI:** "Earlier we identified three red flags in the financials:

1. Rising DSO from 45 to 62 days
2. Inventory turnover declining
3. Aggressive revenue recognition on subscriptions"

### 3. Workspace-Aware Responses

**User:** "Should I continue with this analysis?"

**AI:** "Looking at your AAPL Analysis workspace, you've completed the Data Normalization stage and created an Owner Earnings Bridge artifact. I recommend moving to the Valuation stage next since you now have clean financial data. Would you like help setting up the DCF model?"

### 4. Code for Screeners

**User:** "Find companies with ROIC > 15% and low debt"

**AI:** "Here's the screener query:

````sql
SELECT ticker, name, roic, leverage
FROM companies c
JOIN financial_metrics m ON c.id = m.company_id
WHERE m.roic > 15
  AND m.leverage < 0.3
ORDER BY m.roic DESC
```"

## 📊 Comparison: Before vs After

| Feature | Phase 1 | Phase 2 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Conversation Memory | ❌ Each message standalone | ✅ Remembers last 10 turns |
| Workspace Context | ⚠️ Manual (name, ticker only) | ✅ Auto-loads full context |
| Code Generation | ❌ Text only | ✅ Formulas, SQL, calculations |
| Artifact Awareness | ❌ No knowledge | ✅ Knows what's created |
| Stage Intelligence | ⚠️ Generic instructions | ✅ Stage-specific expertise |
| Multi-turn Reasoning | ❌ Can't reference past | ✅ "Use earlier WACC" works |

---

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test 1: Conversation Memory

````

1. Open AI assistant
2. Ask: "What's a reasonable WACC for tech companies?"
   → AI responds: "8-10% typically"
3. Ask: "Use the midpoint to calculate terminal value with $100M FCF"
   → AI should use 9% (midpoint) without re-asking
   ✅ PASS: AI references earlier WACC

```

### Test 2: Workspace Enrichment

```

1. Create workspace: "MSFT Analysis" with ticker "MSFT"
2. Add description: "Cloud growth thesis"
3. Open AI assistant
4. Ask: "What should I focus on?"
   → AI should mention "MSFT" and "cloud growth" in response
   ✅ PASS: Workspace context included

```

### Test 3: Formula Generation

```

1. Navigate to Valuation stage
2. Open AI assistant
3. Ask: "Generate a DCF formula"
   → AI should provide Excel formula with NPV
   ✅ PASS: Code generation works

```

### Test 4: Artifact Awareness

```

1. In a workspace, create an artifact (via API or manually)
2. Open AI assistant
3. Ask: "What have I created so far?"
   → AI should list artifacts
   ✅ PASS: Artifact awareness
