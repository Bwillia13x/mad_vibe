# Enhanced E2E Testing Suite

This directory contains the enhanced End-to-End (E2E) testing suite that provides comprehensive user workflow validation, accessibility testing, and browser compatibility testing.

## Overview

The enhanced E2E testing suite extends the existing basic E2E tests with:

1. **User Workflow Tests** - Complete demo scenario execution and cross-module workflows
2. **Accessibility Tests** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing and usability validation
3. **Browser Compatibility Tests** - Cross-browser functionality and responsive design testing

## Test Components

### 1. User Workflow Tests (`user-workflow-tests.ts`)

Tests complete user workflows including:

- Demo scenario execution (default, busy day, low inventory, appointment gaps)
- POS complete workflow (add items, apply discounts, checkout, receipt handling)
- Marketing campaign workflow (create, activate, filter, view metrics)
- Loyalty program workflow (add rewards, add points, filter entries)
- Cross-module workflow (navigation between modules, keyboard shortcuts)

### 2. Accessibility Tests (`../accessibility/accessibility-tests.ts`)

Tests accessibility compliance including:

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checking
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Focus management validation
- Screen reader compatibility (basic checks)
- Color contrast validation
- Form label association
- Heading structure validation

### 3. Browser Compatibility Tests (`../browser-compatibility/browser-compatibility-tests.ts`)

Tests cross-browser compatibility including:

- Chrome Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet configurations
- JavaScript feature support (ES6+, async/await, fetch API)
- CSS feature support (Grid, Flexbox, custom properties)
- Form submission functionality
- Navigation and interaction testing
- Performance measurement across browsers

### 4. Responsive Design Tests

Tests responsive design across viewports:

- Mobile Portrait (375x667)
- Mobile Landscape (667x375)
- Tablet Portrait (768x1024)
- Tablet Landscape (1024x768)
- Desktop Small (1280x800)
- Desktop Large (1920x1080)

## Running the Tests

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Run enhanced E2E tests (user workflows only)
npm run test:e2e:enhanced

# Run comprehensive E2E tests (all suites)
npm run test:e2e:comprehensive
```

### Integration with Existing Tests

The enhanced E2E tests integrate with the existing test infrastructure:

```bash
# Run all tests including enhanced E2E
npm run test:comprehensive
```

## Test Results

### Output Formats

Tests generate multiple output formats:

- **Console Output**: Real-time test progress and summary
- **JSON Reports**: Machine-readable test results in `test-results/`
- **HTML Reports**: Human-readable test reports with charts and metrics

### Success Criteria

#### User Workflow Tests

- All demo scenarios load and function correctly
- Form submissions work across all modules
- Cross-module navigation functions properly
- Keyboard shortcuts work as expected

#### Accessibility Tests

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance score > 80/100
- No critical accessibility violations
- Keyboard navigation works on all pages
- Focus management is properly implemented

#### Browser Compatibility Tests

- All core functionality works across browser configurations
- Responsive design adapts properly to different viewports
- JavaScript and CSS features are supported
- Performance meets acceptable thresholds

### Performance Thresholds

- **Page Load Time**: < 3 seconds
- **Interaction Time**: < 1 second
- **Render Time**: < 2 seconds

## Test Configuration

### Environment Variables

The tests use the same environment configuration as existing tests:

- `NODE_ENV=production` for production-like testing
- Dynamic port allocation for parallel test execution
- Automatic server startup and cleanup

### Browser Configuration

Tests run in headless mode by default with:

- Chrome browser engine (Puppeteer)
- Multiple user agent configurations for mobile/tablet simulation
- Viewport simulation for responsive testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Conflicts**: Tests use dynamic port allocation to avoid conflicts
2. **Timeout Issues**: Increase timeout values in test configuration if needed
3. **Browser Launch Failures**: Ensure system has required dependencies for Puppeteer

### Debug Mode

To run tests with additional debugging:

```bash
# Set debug environment variable
DEBUG=1 npm run test:e2e:comprehensive
```

### Screenshots

Failed tests automatically capture screenshots saved to `test-results/screenshots/`

## Integration Points

### Existing Test Infrastructure

The enhanced E2E tests integrate with:

- `TestEnvironment` for server management
- `TestReporter` for result aggregation
- Existing port file system for coordination
- Standard test result formats

### CI/CD Integration

Tests are designed to run in CI/CD environments:

- Headless browser execution
- Exit codes for pass/fail status
- Structured output for parsing
- Artifact generation for reports

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the E2E testing suite:

- Visual regression testing with screenshot comparison
- Performance monitoring and trending
- Real browser testing (Selenium Grid integration)
- Mobile device testing (real device farms)
- Automated accessibility remediation suggestions
