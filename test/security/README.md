# Security Testing Suite

This directory contains comprehensive security testing for the Andreas Vibe platform.

## Overview

The security test suite validates the platform against common security vulnerabilities and best practices before production deployment.

## Test Categories

### 1. Authentication & Session Security (`authentication-security-tests.ts`)

- Admin token validation
- Smoke mode security behavior
- Session security validation
- Authentication bypass prevention
- Session hijacking prevention

### 2. Input Validation & Injection Prevention (`input-validation-tests.ts`)

- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) prevention
- SQL injection prevention
- Malicious payload handling
- Input sanitization validation
- File upload security (when applicable)

### 3. API Security Validation (`api-security-tests.ts`)

- Rate limiting validation
- Authentication bypass testing
- Environment variable security
- API endpoint security headers
- HTTP method security

## Running Security Tests

```bash
# Run all security tests
npm run test:security

# Run with verbose output
TEST_VERBOSE=1 npm run test:security
```

## Test Reports

Security tests generate detailed reports in the `test-results/` directory:

- **Markdown Report**: Human-readable security assessment with recommendations
- **JSON Report**: Machine-readable results for integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Security Findings

The test suite categorizes findings as:

- **Critical Issues**: Must be fixed before production deployment
- **Warnings**: Should be addressed for improved security posture
- **Recommendations**: Best practices for enhanced security

## Expected Results for Demo Platform

The current demo platform is expected to have some security findings:

1. **Missing Security Headers**: The platform lacks security headers like X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.
2. **No Rate Limiting**: API endpoints don't implement rate limiting
3. **Minimal Authentication**: Uses simple token-based auth suitable for demo purposes

These findings are documented and provide a baseline for production hardening.

## Integration with CI/CD

The security test suite exits with code 1 if critical security issues are found, making it suitable for CI/CD pipeline integration:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Run Security Tests
  run: npm run test:security
```

## Customization

Security tests can be customized by modifying:

- Test thresholds in `test/config/test-config.ts`
- Security test cases in individual test files
- Report generation in `security-test-suite.ts`

## Security Best Practices Validated

- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and session management
- API security headers and configuration
- Error handling and information disclosure prevention
- Environment variable security
- HTTP method restrictions
- CORS policy validation

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to the security test suite:

- Automated vulnerability scanning integration
- Dependency vulnerability checking
- SSL/TLS configuration testing
- Content Security Policy validation
- OWASP Top 10 compliance checking
