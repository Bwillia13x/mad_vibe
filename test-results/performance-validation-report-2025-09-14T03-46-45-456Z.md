- **Spike Load Testing**: Tests system resilience under sudden load increases

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Performance Readiness Score: 85%

⚠️ **REQUIRES ATTENTION**

While significant performance improvements have been implemented, the following issues need to be addressed before production deployment:

- Throughput (0.5 RPS) below threshold (10 RPS)

Please address these issues and re-run the performance validation.

## Next Steps

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ensure performance monitoring remains active in production
2. **Regular Testing**: Schedule periodic performance tests to maintain standards
3. **Capacity Planning**: Monitor growth and plan for scaling as needed
4. **Performance Optimization**: Continue optimizing based on real-world usage patterns
