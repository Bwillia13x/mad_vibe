## Security Recommendations

- Fix authentication security failures before production deployment
- Address input validation failures to prevent injection attacks
- Add security headers to all API endpoints
- Consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Add request logging and monitoring for security events
- Implement proper error handling to prevent information disclosure
- Consider adding API authentication for sensitive endpoints
- Implement CORS policy appropriate for production environment
- Directory traversal protection is working correctly
- HTTP method restrictions are properly configured
- Header injection protection is working correctly
- Authentication bypass protection is working correctly
- Implement proper session management with secure cookies and session regeneration
- CSRF protection is properly implemented
- Information disclosure protection is working correctly
- Rate limiting protection is working correctly

## Production Readiness Assessment

❌ **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION** - Critical security issues must be resolved before deployment.

### Next Steps
1. **URGENT:** Fix all critical security issues
2. Re-run security validation
3. Address high and medium priority issues
