# üöÄ MadLab Development Roadmap & Codebase Audit

**Audit Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Project:** MadLab (Andreas Vibe) - Investment Research Platform  
**Current Version:** 1.0.0  
**Overall Status:** 92% Production Ready (Warehouse automation scheduled; dashboards pending BI rollout)

---

## üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current State Assessment

The MadLab platform is an ambitious **investment research IDE** built on Express + Vite + React + TypeScript with a sophisticated tri-pane workbench architecture. Core schema, audit logging, and workspace features are aligned with production requirements. Phase 13 (Reviewer Automation & Collaboration) shipped with expanded workflow persistence, SLA-aware reviewer tooling, and shared memo drafts; the remaining focus is shipping Phase 3 observability dashboards and completing the warehouse analytics loop.

### Key Findings

‚úÖ **Strengths:**

- Comprehensive architecture with 16-stage workflow system
- Modern tech stack (React 18, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL)
- Extensive UI component library (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui)
- Performance monitoring and security infrastructure in place
- Good test infrastructure (Vitest, E2E, accessibility tests)
- Well-documented with multiple architecture guides

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Issues:**

- Observability dashboards not yet implemented (analytics warehouse views ready)
- BigQuery sync automation configured but pending first production run/verification
- Several mock/placeholder data services not yet replaced with real APIs

üîÑ **In Progress:**

- Phase 3 Milestone A observability dashboards + alerting (specs in `docs/ai-audit-observability.md`)
- Apply `migrations/0007_phase13_collaboration.sql` across environments and validate reviewer SLA + shared-draft smoke tests
- Updated playbook now includes dashboard layouts, PagerDuty/Slack configuration, sync cadence, and Data Platform checklist (see `docs/ai-audit-observability.md` Step 3-6)
- BigQuery selected, service account provisioned, automation workflow `.github/workflows/ai-audit-sync.yml` created; awaiting initial run validation
- Universe screener with placeholder filtering logic
- Data stream services (market data, news, filings) currently on mock data

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL BLOCKERS (MUST FIX BEFORE DEPLOYMENT)

### Priority 1: Observability Dashboards & Alerting

**Why it matters:**

- Compliance and on-call teams need `ai_audit_logs` visibility before launch.
- Warehouse views (`analytics.ai_audit_daily`, `analytics.ai_audit_workspace_stats`) are in place; dashboards still need to be instantiated.

**What remains:**

1. Build Looker/Metabase Overview, Workspace, and Capability tabs per `docs/ai-audit-observability.md`.
2. Configure PagerDuty service `ai-audit-observability` and Slack routing (`#ai-copilot-ops`).
3. Enable `.github/workflows/ai-audit-sync.yml` (hourly delta + nightly full) once secrets are populated; confirm freshness SLOs (<5 min).
4. Follow the Data Platform checklist in `docs/ai-audit-observability.md` Step 6 for deployment sequencing.

**Blocking Dependencies:**

- Populate GitHub secrets (`DATABASE_URL`, `AI_AUDIT_BQ_CREDENTIALS_JSON`) and complete first successful sync.

---

## üéØ PHASE 1: STABILIZATION & TYPE SAFETY (IMMEDIATE - Week 1)

### 1.1 Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Tasks:**

- [x] Fix all type mismatches in `shared/demoData.ts` (convert string prices to numbers)
- [x] Update analytics demo data to match schema requirements
- [x] Resolve server-side type errors in routes and storage
- [x] Fix component type errors in PostMortem, panels, and stage-tabs
- [x] Run `npm run check` until zero errors
- [x] Verify build completes: `npm run build`

**Files to Modify:**

```typescript
// shared/demoData.ts - Convert all string prices to numbers
unitCost: 12.75,        // NOT '12.75'
retailPrice: 18.99,     // NOT '18.99'

// Add missing analytics properties
revenue: 15420,
appointments: 89,
newCustomers: 12,
avgTicket: 173.26
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ `npm run check`, `npm run build`, and smoke tests pass as of Oct 3, 2025.

## üî® PHASE 2: DATA INTEGRATION (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Replace Mock Data Services with Real APIs

**Current Mock Services:**

- `client/src/services/data-streams.ts` - Market movers, earnings calendar, SEC filings, news feed

ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here
NEWS_API_KEY=your_key_here
SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT=company_name contact@email.com
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks
