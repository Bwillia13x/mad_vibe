- Production database migration scripts, seed/rollback plan

> **Current focus**: Milestone 3 â€“ IC memo export + scenario lab enhancements, then move into persistence and collaboration.

### Remaining focus after current update
- Milestone 3 complete: memo export, scenario lab enhancements, execution automation, and quality governance scorecard.
- Milestone 4: Next migrate valuation and monitoring contexts to the API layer and introduce shared audit history.
- Milestone 4+: Extend collaboration stories (multi-user sessions, reviewer assignments) once API groundwork lands.
