# Valor-IVX Workflow Completion Roadmap (Updated)

## Milestone 1 â€“ Workflow Shell & Persistence âœ…

- Stage navigation, checklist gating, Omni-prompt
- Research log API + DB persistence, demo seeds
- Workflow-wide contexts for normalization, owner earnings, valuation, memo, monitoring

## Milestone 2 â€“ Analyst Workbenches âœ…

- **Data & Adjustments**: Source coverage dashboard, adjustment toggles
- **Financials**: Owner earnings bridge with history
- **Valuation**: EPV/DCf scenario toggles, assumption overrides
- **Memo Composer**: Section editor, review checklist
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Thesis deltas, lessons, alert acknowledgements

## Milestone 3 â€“ Remaining IDE Modules âœ…

1. **IC Memo Export** â€“ polish âœ…
   - Rich PDF/HTML template with IC header, exhibit appendix, reviewer thread timeline
   - Exhibit attachments configurable from memo workbench with analyst annotations
   - Reviewer comment threads persisted and surfaced in export preview
2. **Scenario Lab Enhancements** âœ…
   - Parameter controls with Monte Carlo summary feeding Monitoring
   - Presets for bear/base/bull
3. **Execution Planner Automation** âœ… (phase 1)
   - Order templates generated from valuation + scenario data feeds
   - Route suggestions auto-gate on monitoring alerts and thesis deltas
   - Risk budget panel wiring downside probability, guard rails, and allocation caps
4. **Quality & Governance** âœ…
   - Score reporting with evidence links and aggregated IC readiness grade

## Milestone 4 â€“ Persistence & Collaboration

- Replace browser storage with API endpoints for normalization, valuation, memo, monitoring state
- Memo composer state (sections, exhibits, reviewer threads) now persisted via `/api/workflow/memo-state` âœ…
- Data normalization reconciliation state now persisted via `/api/workflow/normalization-state` âœ…
- Valuation selections and overrides now persisted via `/api/workflow/valuation-state` âœ…
- Monitoring acknowledgements and delta overrides now persisted via `/api/workflow/monitoring-state` âœ…
- Multi-user session support with audit history ðŸ”œ
- Shared presence indicators and optimistic locking for concurrent analysts ðŸ”œ
- Reviewer assignment workflow with notification hooks ðŸ”œ
- Audit timeline surfacing persisted activity (workflow edits, exports, approvals) ðŸ”œ

## Milestone 5 â€“ Testing & Deployment

- Expand Vitest coverage to new endpoints & hooks
- CI workflow running `npm run test:workflow`, smoke, lint, typecheck
- Production database migration scripts, seed/rollback plan

> **Current focus**: Milestone 4 â€“ Persistence & Collaboration (sessions, audit timeline, reviewer workflow).

### Next phase priorities

- Stand up real-time session presence, optimistic locking, and conflict notifications across memo and valuation workbenches.
- Implement workspace-level audit timeline with filters, export, and reviewer acknowledgment trail.
- Ship reviewer assignment workflow, including notifications and status tracking for outstanding reviews.
- Prepare integration tests and monitoring dashboards needed to graduate Milestone 4 deliverables into Milestone 5 QA.
