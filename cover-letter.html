    <!-- Salutation -->
    <p>To: Hiring Team, WestJet</p>
    <p class="muted">Role: FP&A Financial Analyst — Ref 100880 · Calgary, AB (YYC)</p>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I am excited to apply for the FP&A Financial Analyst position at WestJet (Ref: 100880). With a
      background in finance, risk management, and product analytics, I specialize in developing
      lightweight tools that accelerate team decisions. My expertise lies in transforming ambiguous
      challenges into actionable plans, driver-based models, and executive-ready insights.
    </p>

    <!-- Why Company / Why This Role -->
    <h2>Why WestJet and this role</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Operational finance at scale:</strong> WestJet’s extensive network, fleet expansion,
        and Sunwing integration present complex planning challenges—connecting capacity, yield, and
        costs to reliable budgets and forecasts. I thrive in mapping business drivers to KPIs (e.g.,
        load factor, RASM/CASM, fuel and crew costs), enabling leaders to understand
        cause-and-effect relationships clearly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Decision cadence:</strong> This role's focus on monthly forecasts, annual budgets,
        KPI monitoring, and variance analysis aligns with my preference for reproducible
        workflows—featuring clear inputs, versioned assumptions, and concise one-pager summaries
        tailored for senior stakeholders.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hybrid collaboration:</strong> As a Calgary resident, I am fully prepared for the
        hybrid model, committing to three days per week on campus to collaborate effectively with
        FP&A, Operations, and Accounting teams, ensuring tight integration between analysis,
        decisions, and outcomes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Role‑aligned experience -->
    <h2>Role‑aligned experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Driver‑based modeling & scenarios:</strong> Developed valuation and planning models
        (DCF/EPV and operating bridges) alongside a streamlined FP&A workbench that interconnects
        assumptions with outputs, incorporating sensitivity analysis and scenario toggles.
        Proficient in advanced Excel (XLOOKUP/INDEX‑MATCH, PivotTables, Power Query) complemented by
        Python and SQL for efficient data extraction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Forecasts, budgets, and variance hygiene:</strong> Managed rolling forecasts and
        annual planning packages, including variance bridges against prior periods, budgets, and
        forecasts; identified risks and opportunities while maintaining auditable documentation for
        updates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>KPI dashboards & communication:</strong> Created weekly and monthly reporting
        packets tailored to leadership requirements—highlighting key KPIs, expense trends, and
        succinct commentary—to facilitate decision-focused discussions rather than data
        interpretation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Systems & BI:</strong> Experienced in enterprise systems (e.g., Oracle
        EPM/Hyperion), with strong SQL skills and proficiency in modern BI tools (Power BI/Tableau)
        for rapid prototyping that evolves into standardized reports.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cross‑functional partnering:</strong> Collaborated extensively with operations and
        accounting teams to convert policy decisions and accounting entries into measurable
        operational impacts, ensuring alignment on timelines and responsibilities.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- First 90 days / What I will deliver -->
    <h2>What I will deliver in the first 90 days</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Driver map & baseline forecast:</strong> Document WestJet’s primary revenue and cost
        drivers for the assigned portfolio; establish a clean baseline with explicit assumptions and
        a living change‑log.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Variance playbook:</strong> Develop a simple, repeatable variance framework (price ×
        volume, rate × mix, timing) and a one‑page monthly packet highlighting risks/opportunities
        and required follow‑ups.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scenario set:</strong> Define 3–4 standard scenarios (base, upside, cost‑pressure,
        demand‑shock) with sensitivity tables to support tactical and strategic decisions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ops business review deck contribution:</strong> Co‑author the monthly operations
        review deck sections for my area; ensure numbers reconcile to Accounting and that commentary
        is crisp and decision‑oriented.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Closing -->
    <h2>Closing</h2>
    <p>
      I look forward to the opportunity to discuss WestJet's current FP&A priorities and share
      examples of my models, dashboards, and review packets. Thank you for considering my
      application.
